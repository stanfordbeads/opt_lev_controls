If the bead falls out:

1) Take "chameleon" data without bead

2) Take gravity data without bead
    a) Just y-drive
    b) with z-drive to "straighten"

3) Take dipole data without bead

4) Measure noise with feedback still on

5) Determine cantilever distance to trap

6) Profile Beam

7) Take "chameleon" data far away for vibration test

8) Use CC to determine turbo base pressure

9) RGA Scan? Leak Test?
